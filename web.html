          <p>You asked me to e-mail you about the <strong>(144)_____</strong> of my office. Overall, it is very nice and suits most of my needs. However, I would like a few small changes.

          <p>My office also needs some technology upgrades. The computer’s Internet connection is slow and frequently freezes in the afternoons. It is very frustrating.

          <p>I will need a visit from the IT specialist. I should have antivirus software installed on my computer. Maybe my current computer has it, but I <strong>(146)_____</strong> find it.</p>

Last month, during the first week of July, I phoned the customer service line to let them know I was going to switch my cable modem connection for a wireless connection. I have explained how the cable modem connection disconnects without warning during bad weather, most likely because the signal can’t reach the modem during a bad storm. I have contacted your offices at Sysmax about the problem, and ended up switching to your wireless connection.</p>
          <p>The kind lady that helped me on the other line at your customer services apologized for the problem and said she would not bill me for the cable modem for last month. It turns out I got charged with the cable modem bill and the wireless connection bill. I would appreciate it, if you, at Sysmax, can send me a new bill without the charges for the cable modem connection, and I will happily keep using your company’s services as long as this matter is handled. By the way, I am currently happy with the speed of the wireless connection.</p>

          <p><strong>Long Beach, California, August 4th</strong></p>
          <p>The board of directors of TCO entertainment has announced today that the CEO of the company, Mike Jones, has stepped down from the position. The changes will take place immediately, and the new CEO of the massive company will be Joan Chase, as said by the board of directors.</p>
          <p>“When Mr. Mike Jones was given the position of CEO in this company back in ’95, he was anxious and tried his hardest to do better for the company. After his success got to him, there were a lot of problems between him and the employees, and such incidents led to two strikes just last year,” said Clearance McArthur, on behalf of the board. “I have seen this company get larger and build success as time has passed,” said Mike Jones. “I have realized even though I have helped this company get big, I do not want to disrespect it and see it fall apart just because of one man. I am sorry.”</p>
          <p>There was no word from Joan Chase, the future CEO of the company. Short facts about him are: he graduated with a master’s degree in gaming management from UNLV, and has worked for the company for 17 years. He enjoys the company’s own products, such as <em>Ground Zero 2</em>, available now in stores everywhere. The minimum requirements for <em>Ground Zero 2</em> are 512 MB of RAM, a 128 MB graphics card, and a 2.40 gig CPU.</p>

          <p><strong>Outlaw Steakhouse Inspection Note</strong><br>
          Date: March 14th, 2006<br>
          To: Jon Davis, Kitchen Manager<br>
          From: Nathan Benjamin, President<br>
          RE: Inspection notes</p>
          <p>I have received word from the Safety Officer of Outlaw Steakhouse yesterday about a few things that he thinks need to be corrected after his inspection last week. Outlaw Steakhouse Long Beach, California (our second Outlaw Steakhouse and the one you are working at) has received 74 points out of a 100. That is very low, you know I expect at least an 85.</p>
          <p>The areas where you got docked points were the fire exit, the dishwasher, air conditioner, stairway and the grill.</p>
          <p>The fire exit had a few boxes stacked in front of the door, and the safety officer has seen the employees walk over the boxes to the other side of the kitchen, too. The fire exit was blocked and the employees were having a hard time moving around the kitchen. The dishwasher was dirty, it was out of bleach. The air conditioner needed cleaning, the stairways were slippery, and the grill had a lot of grease on the stainless steel.</p>
          <p>The safety officer will be making a visit to your restaurant. March 17th, which is 3 days from now. Please take care of ALL of these problems, or there are going to be more problems and even a risk of losing your manager position.</p>

            <p>You can contact us to cancel the order, or if you can bear with us for the moment, we would be thankful and will

          <p>Dear Rodney Locksmith,</p>
          <p>I have looked thoroughly at the programs listed on the handout you have sent me. I can't sign up for any of these programs because my phone isn't new enough. For example, what is this color photo program? Most everyone I know does not have a cell phone that can take pictures, and the walkie talkie program? That is also a top of the line cell phone too.</p>
          <p>I have no idea why you released programs on such a wide scale, I am pretty sure 95% of your customers don't even have phones that can actually use this program. The other rates you have on here, the free 100 minutes a month program sounds good, but you have to pay 5 more dollars per month.</p>
          <p>In the long run, each one of these rates is the same as old ones and some, I can't even use. I really see no point in sending these out to every one of your customers. One of my friends just tossed it away after looking at it for 30 seconds. Please, do not send me any one of these catalogues again, it just takes up space in my mailbox and adds trash.</p>
          <p>Your customer,<br>Anthony Chu</p>

Our records show that for the past six months there have been no assets in your account and you have not placed a trade. If you would like to keep your account open, there are a number of ways to fund the account:</p>
            <p><strong>Checks:</strong> The easiest way is by depositing a check. Complete the investment coupon below and return it with your check.</p>
            <p><strong>Electronic Fund Transfer:</strong> You may electronically transfer cash into your account from another financial institution using our proprietary funds transfer service.</p>
            <p><strong>Account Transfers:</strong> You can transfer investments from another brokerage firm to your account by completing an Account Transfer Form, which can be obtained by calling customer service.</p>
            <p>If we can answer any questions or if you need assistance in transferring assets to your account, please call Customer Service at 1-800-475-5000.</p>

            <p>In case you haven't seen a television or newspaper in the last week, let me be the first to tell you that there are at least <strong>5 new computer viruses</strong> in circulation right now. Many of them are extraordinarily destructive.</p>
            <p>Until further notice, <strong>do not open any attachments</strong> to any messages unless you know what the attachment is <em>and</em> you need the attachment to do your work. Do not open jokes, games, pictures, or anything else without receiving verification from the sender that the attachment was sent intentionally and is safe to open.</p>
            <p>The new viruses are unusually deceptive to trick you into activating them. They may come disguised as almost anything, including invoices for products you did not buy or even patches to protect against computer viruses. <strong>On our network, virus protection updates will never come as an attachment sent by e-mail.</strong></p>
            <p>If you have any questions, please ask me, Pam, or Connie before opening any dubious attachment. Two clicks may be all it takes to bring our entire organization to a grinding halt for many hours.</p>

My ETS reports were supposed to come in today in my e-mail, and I had an e-mail in my inbox that said “ETS reports for January.” I clicked, and the computer started going crazy. I was working overtime, and the only ones in the office were me and Chris. He said after I opened the mail, his computer went crazy too. Please contact me as soon as possible.

So if you guys are going to discuss it, please let me know. I will be there. If not, I might be there to hear some other plans, but probably not. Thank you. Please contact me as soon as possible.

              <strong>Subject:</strong> Workshop logistics<br>
              <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 10<br>
              <strong>Attach:</strong> Workshop schedule</p>
            <p>Ms. Bao,</p>
            <p>I have attached a draft of the schedule for the upcoming workshop. I wish we had scheduled it for a week from today instead of the day after tomorrow. There is still a lot to get ready; however, we can’t change the date now. I really appreciate your support in getting things ready.</p>
            <p>There are some things I need you to take care of. Tea and snacks should be ready right after Mr. Chang’s presentation. He plans to talk for just an hour, so there will be time for this before the next presentation at 11:00. Also, the room we have scheduled for lunch is one of the smaller rooms, and serving a meal there would be difficult. In addition, we have a workshop scheduled at the same time as the Demographics workshop. Could you swap the room scheduled for lunch with the one scheduled for <em>Analyzing Demographics</em>?</p>
            <p>Please make sure there are enough chairs in each room for everyone. So far, 45 people have registered for the workshop, but a few more registrations could come in today or tomorrow. You should have 15 extra chairs in each room in case of need. There is one last schedule change. Mr. Wang will have to give his presentation in the morning. Please give him Ms. Lee’s time slot, and she can take Mr. Wang’s afternoon time slot. Send me the revised schedule this afternoon. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Annual leave days must be used up by the end of the calendar year or they will be forfeited. The actual dates when leave days may be taken are dependent on permission from the employee's supervisor. To apply to use annual leave days, the employee must complete form number 465, obtain the supervisor's permission and signature, and submit the form to the human resource director no later than 21 calendar days before the date when the requested leave will begin. Incomplete or late requests will not be reviewed and leave will not be granted.</p>

              <strong>Sent:</strong> Tuesday, October 3</p>
            <p>Marilyn,</p>
            <p>Here's a link to an office rental ad I found online: www.offices.com/10-01. I think it's worth looking at even though the rent is a bit high. I know it is a good deal more than we are paying now, but look at the size. It's twice as big as our current office, and I'm sure we can use the space. And it has a kitchen and bathroom and a reception area just like we have now.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately it is nowhere near a subway station. That is a convenience I would miss having, but it does have parking, unlike our current office. I'm sure our clients would appreciate that. It would also be good to be in a building with an elevator. I'm really tired of using the stairs.</p>
            <p>I'd like to see the space as soon as possible. Could you call and make an appointment? Try and get one for tomorrow if you can, because after that I'll be away until next Monday, as you know. Thanks.<br>Paul</p>
